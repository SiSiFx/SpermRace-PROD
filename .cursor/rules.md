- Always consult CONTEXT.md before changing gameplay or networking
- Keep PixiJS v8 API usage (.rect().fill(), .stroke(), .circle(), .roundRect())
- Do not re‑enable removed components or duplicate game files
- Prefer small, safe edits; keep production server path /ws stable
- Respect TypeScript types and avoid any; fix lints
