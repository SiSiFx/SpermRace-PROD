# SpermRace.io - The "High-Fidelity" Redesign

**Objective:** Transform SpermRace.io into a world-class, visually stunning Bio-Cyberpunk experience. Every pixel should feel high-end, futuristic, and "alive".

**The Vibe:**
*   **Bio-Cyberpunk:** A mix of sleek futuristic technology and organic, biological elements.
*   **High-Stakes:** The UI should feel like a high-tech combat interface (HUD).
*   **Colors:** Deep blacks, electric cyans, neon greens, and warning ambers.

**Focus Areas:**
1.  **First Impression:** The landing page and main menu need to look like a premium game. High-quality typography, glowing effects, and a sense of depth.
2.  **Combat Interface (HUD):** Reskin the in-game UI to look like a tactical pilot's display. It should be minimal but packed with "cool" tech details (scanlines, glass effects, slick animations).
3.  **The Wait (Lobby):** The lobby and matchmaking experience should build anticipation. Make the player list and tournament selection look like high-tech data panels.
4.  **Victory/Defeat:** Make the end-of-match results feel cinematic. Victory should feel like a glorious success; defeat should feel like a critical system failure.
5.  **Fluidity:** Ensure all animations are smooth and the UI is perfectly responsive on both Desktop and Mobile.

**Ralph's Task:**
Analyze the current codebase and execute a complete visual overhaul across all components. You have full creative control to implement the best designs, animations, and layouts that fit the "Bio-Cyberpunk" theme. Do not just change colors—rethink the shapes, the animations, and the user flow to make it truly "AA" quality.
