**Goal:** Make the game feel responsive, fair, and "juicy".

**Key Problems to Fix:**
1.  **Ghost Bots:** In practice mode, when bots die, the HUD (Alive count & Kill feed) often doesn't update immediately. This feels buggy.
2.  **Confusing End:** When the player loses, the results screen is generic. It should tell me exactly *who* won (e.g., "Winner: Bot_X"), my rank, and my stats.
3.  **Flat Combat:** Eliminations feel flat. Add visual impact (screen shake, red flash) when the player dies, and rewards (visual/audio) for getting kills or narrow escapes.

**Constraint:** Ensure the Ralph dashboard remains stable.
